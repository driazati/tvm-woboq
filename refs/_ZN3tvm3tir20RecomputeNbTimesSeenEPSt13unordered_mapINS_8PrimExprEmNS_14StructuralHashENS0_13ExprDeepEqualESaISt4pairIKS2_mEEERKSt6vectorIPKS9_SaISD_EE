 * \brief Recompute the number of times that each computation in table_main is seen in the tables
          contained by the vector of tables vecTables. It sets each element to the sum of the times
          it is seen in each individual table.
 * \param table_main The main table, for which we recompute the counters.
 * \param vecTables The vector of tables which won&apos;t change.
 * \note This function is needed because both the intersection (A Inter B) and the union
 *        (A U B U C) adds the individual counters found in A, B and C. So when we treat for
 *        instance an If (which contains a Cond, a Then branch and an Else branch),
 *        it will compute (Then Inter Else) U (Cond Inter Then) U (Cond Inter Else).
 *        In order to get back to the appropriate number (for instance, 3 if seen one time in each
 *        bloc), it is therefore necessary to recompute the counters afterwards, which is what this
 *        function does.
