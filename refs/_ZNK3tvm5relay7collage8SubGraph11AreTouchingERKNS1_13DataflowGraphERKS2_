   * \brief Returns true if:
   *  - \p this and \p that are disjoint, and
   *  - an output node of \p this coincides with an entry node of \p that, and
   *  - \p this and \p that are not obviously invalid after \p DisjointUnion
   *    (eg because such a sub-graph would produce a cycle).
   * Note however that the \p DisjointUnion may not necessarily be valid even with the above
   * checks.
