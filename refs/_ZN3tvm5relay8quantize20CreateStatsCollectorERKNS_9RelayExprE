 * \brief Given an annotated graph, create a profile graph to collect profile data from the
 * calibration dataset.
 *
 * This pass collects simulated_quantize op into a tuple. Simulated_quantize ops are rewritten to
 * identity mode. The tuple is the output of the profile graph. Both input and output of this pass
 * are relay::Function.
 *
 * \param expr The simulation graph after annotation.
 * \return The profile graph.
