 * \brief Builds a table for a node that has three children. A computation will be reported
   as being computed if it appears in at least two of the children, i.e. if it will aways be
   computed, regardless of the execution path.
 * \param table_child1 The table of computations done by the first child.
 * \param table_child2 The table of computations done by the second child.
 * \param table_child3 The table of computations done by the third child.
 * \note This function will be used for obtaining the computations done by If nodes and by For
 * nodes, which both have three children.
