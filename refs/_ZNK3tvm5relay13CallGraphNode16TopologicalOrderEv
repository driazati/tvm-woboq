   * \brief Get the entries from the CallGraphNode in the topological order.
   *
   *  This is useful for various module-level optimizations/analysis. For example,
   *  inlining requires the correct order of the functions being processed, i.e.
   *  callee should be always handled before callers.
   *
   * \return The list of collected entries that are sorted in the topological order.
