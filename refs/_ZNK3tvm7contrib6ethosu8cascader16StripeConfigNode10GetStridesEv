   * \brief Get the strides of the stripe config.
   * \return The strides of the stripe config.
   * \note The strides refer to the stride between stripes in each axis.
   * The strides are represented as a float rather than an int to account for
   * cases of &apos;fractional striding&apos;. The stride should therefore be interpreted
   * as the average striding in each axis.
   *
   * The starting offset of the i-th stripe in axis &apos;ax&apos; is given by:
   *
   * stripe_offset_i[ax] = offset[ax] + floor(strides[ax]*i)
   *
   * As a concrete example, consider a 2x2 upscaling operation. If an output
   * stripe config with a stride of (3, 3) is chosen, then when this is
   * propagated to the input it will be reduced by a factor of two to become
   * (1.5, 1.5).
   *
   * This means the first stripe in axis 0 should begin at (floor(1.5*0), 0) = (0, 0),
   * the second at (floor(1.5*1), 0) = (1, 0), and the third at (floor(1.5*2), 0) =
   * (3, 0). This results in irregular striding where &apos;strides&apos; is the average
   * striding value.
