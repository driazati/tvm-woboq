   * \brief Constructs a first-order domain for \p virtual_device, which may be
   * fully free (ie virtual_device is unconstrained), partially  free (ie virtual_device has at
   * least on of its target, device id or memory scopes known), or fully fixed (ie virtual_device
   * has its target, device id and memory scopes set).
   *
   * CAUTION: Use DeviceDomains::MakeFirstOrderDomain instead of this ctor.
