   * Removing the specified store, which may reflow known values.
   * This is necessary when simplifying sequential stores of the same
   * value.  Otherwise, the first could be removed as a no-op because
   * it is overwritten by the second, and the second could be removed
   * as a no-op because it is the same value as the first.
