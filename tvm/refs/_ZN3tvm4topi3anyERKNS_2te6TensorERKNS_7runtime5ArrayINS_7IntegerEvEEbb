 * \brief Creates an operation that computes the logical OR of elements
 * over a given axis
 *
 * \param data The input boolean tensor
 * \param axis The axes to reduce. If axis is empty, the operation will
 * perform logical OR over all elements of the array.
 * \param keepdims If this is set to true, the axes which are reduced are
 * left in the result as dimensions with size one. This enables the result
 * to broadcast correctly against the input array.
 * \param atleast1d Whether the output need to be atleast1d.
 *
 * \return A Tensor whose op member is the all operation
