   * \brief get a chunk of memory that can contain multiple records,
   *  with hint for how many records is needed,
   *  the caller needs to parse the content of the resulting chunk,
   *  for text file, out_chunk can contain data of multiple lines
   *  for recordio, out_chunk can contain multiple records(including headers)
   *
   *  This function ensures there won&apos;t be partial record in the chunk
   *  caller can modify the memory content of out_chunk,
   *  the memory is valid until next call to NextRecord, NextChunk or NextBatch
   *
   *
   * \param out_chunk used to store the result
   * \param n_records used as a hint for how many records should be returned, may be ignored
   * \return true if we can successfully get next record
   *     false if we reached end of split
   * \sa InputSplit::Create for definition of record
   * \sa RecordIOChunkReader to parse recordio content from out_chunk
