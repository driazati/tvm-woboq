 * \brief A faster implementation of atof(). Unlike std::atof(), this function
 *        returns float type. Note that this function does not check for overflow.
 * TODO: the current version does not support hex number
 * TODO: the current version does not handle long decimals: you may only have
 *       up to 19 digits after the decimal point, and you cannot have too many
 *       digits before the decimal point either.
 * \param nptr Beginning of the string that&apos;s to be converted into float
 * \return Converted value, in float type
