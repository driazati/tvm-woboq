   * \brief Push data into unframer and try to decode one packet.
   *
   * This function will return when exactly one packet has been decoded. It may not consume all of
   * `data` in this case, and valid bytes may remain at the end of data.
   *
   * \param data The new data to unframe and send downstream.
   * \param data_size_bytes The number of valid bytes in data.
   * \param bytes_consumed Pointer written with the number of bytes consumed from data.
   * \return
   *     - kTvmErrorNoError when successful -- continue writing data.
   *     - kTvmErrorFramingInvalidState when the Unframer was in or enters an invalid state
   *       (probably indicates memory corruption).
   *     - kTvmErrorFramingShortPacket when a new packet started before the current one ended.
   *     - kTvmErrorFramingInvalidEscape when an invalid escape sequence was seen
