   * \brief Spare an entry to be the head of a linked list.
   * As described in B3, during insertion, it is possible that the entire linked list does not
   * exist, but the slot of its head has been occupied by other linked lists. In this case, we need
   * to spare the slot by moving away the elements to another valid empty one to make insertion
   * possible.
   * \param target The given entry to be spared
   * \param key The indexing key
   * \param result The linked-list entry constructed as the head
   * \return A boolean, if actual insertion happens
