 * \brief Creates an operation that finds the indices of the maximum
 * values over a given axis.
 *
 * \param data The input tensor
 * \param axis The axis along which the argmax is performed. If axis is empty,
 * the operation will find the maximum index over all elements of the array.
 * \param keepdims If this is set to true, the axes which are reduced are
 * left in the result as dimensions with size one. This enables the result
 * to broadcast correctly against the input array.
 * \param atleast1d Whether the output need to be atleast1d.
 * \param select_last_index Whether to select the last index if the maximum element
 * appears multiple times, else select the first index.
 * \return A Tensor whose op member is the argmax operation
