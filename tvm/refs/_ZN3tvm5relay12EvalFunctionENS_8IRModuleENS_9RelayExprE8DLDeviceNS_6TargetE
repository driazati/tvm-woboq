 * \brief Returns a packed function over Relay expressions which will evaluate \p expr
 * applied to those arguments, where \p expr is w.r.t. the definitions in \p mod.
 *
 * This function is intended to support the Python &apos;debug&apos; executor.
 *
 * The given \p expr should have function type. The given \p mod may be empty or
 * undefined if \p expr is self-contained. Relay arguments passed to the result
 * packed function must be constants, references, or constructors/tuples over such.
 * As much work as possible is done while constructing the result packed function, and
 * that function may be reasonably efficiently applied multiple times without redoing
 * unnecessary work.
 *
 * Primitives are lowered and compiled to packed functions for execution on \p device
 * with properties given by \p target. All other Relay constructs are interpreted.
 *
 * The interpreter is intended to be a &apos;reference&apos; implementation of the Relay semantics
 * for testing and interactive use. It is not intended to be particularly efficient.
 *
 * \param mod A module containing definitions which can be referenced from
 * \p expr. May be empty or undefined.
 * \param expr An expression of function type to evaluate. May reference definitions from \p mod.
 * \param device The device on which all primitives will be executed.
 * \param target The compiler target flag for compiling primitives.
 * \return A packed function that takes an array of Relay expressions and returns the
 * result of applying \p expr to those arguments.
