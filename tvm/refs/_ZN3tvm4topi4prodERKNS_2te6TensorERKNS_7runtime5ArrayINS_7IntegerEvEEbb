 * \brief Creates product operation over given axis.
 *
 * \param data The input tensor
 * \param axis The axis to do product over. If axis is empty, the
 * operation will do the product over all elements of the array.
 * \param keepdims If this is set to true, the axes which are reduced are
 * left in the result as dimensions with size one. This enables the result
 * to broadcast correctly against the input array.
 * \param atleast1d Whether the output need to be atleast1d.
 *
 * \return A Tensor whose op member is the prod operation
