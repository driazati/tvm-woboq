     *  @brief  The generated relational operators are sequestered here.
     *
     *  Libstdc++ headers must not use the contents of `rel_ops`.
     *  User code should also avoid them, because unconstrained function
     *  templates are too greedy and can easily cause ambiguities.
     *
     *  C++20 default comparisons are a better solution.
