   * \brief Creates a collection of threads which run a provided function.
   *
   * \param num_workers The total number of worker threads in this group.
            Includes main thread if `exclude_worker0 = true`
   * \param worker_callback A callback which is run in its own thread.
            Receives the worker_id as an argument.
   * \param exclude_worker0 Whether to use the main thread as a worker.
   *        If  `true`, worker0 will not be launched in a new thread and
   *        `worker_callback` will only be called for values &gt;= 1. This
   *        allows use of the main thread as a worker.
