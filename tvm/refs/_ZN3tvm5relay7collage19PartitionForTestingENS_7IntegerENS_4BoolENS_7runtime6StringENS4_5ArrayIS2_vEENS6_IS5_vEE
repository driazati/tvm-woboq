 * \brief A pass which partitions (the unique) global function in the module according to the
 * post-dfs indexes in \p indexes. The partitioning must respect the configuration with \p max_exits
 * and \p allow_taps.
 *
 * Each index is also paired with a label. A non-empty label denotes the index should also be
 * included in a nested sub-graph which will be extracted as a function with the label as its
 * &quot;Composite&quot; attribute. An empty label denotes the index should go into the overall partitioned
 * &quot;Compiler&quot; function. In this way we can simulate the usual partitioning needed by external
 * codegen integrations.
 *
 * This function is intended to support \p SubGraph unit tests and is not used by the regular
 * compilation flow.
