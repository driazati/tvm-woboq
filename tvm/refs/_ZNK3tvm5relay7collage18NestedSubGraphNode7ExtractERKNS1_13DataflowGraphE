   * \brief Returns the function representing this nested sub-graph within the overall expression
   * represented by \p dataflow_graph:
   *  - All sub-graph inputs become parameters.
   *  - All sub-graph outputs become function results (either directly or as a field in a tuple).
   *  - The function has attrs_ for attributes (which may be empty).
   *  - The function body accounts for any rewrites implied by the nested sub-graph.
