 * \brief Perform global pooling on height and width dimension of data.
 *        It decides the height and width dimension according to the layout string,
 *        in which &apos;W&apos; and &apos;H&apos; means width and height respectively.
 *        Width and height dimension cannot be split.
 *        For example, NCHW, NCHW16c, ... are valid for global_pool,
 *        while NCHW16w, NCHW16h are not.
 *        See \a layout for more information of the layout string convention.
 *
 * \param x The input tensor represent as layout
 * \param pool_type The type of pooling operator
 * \param layout The input layout. global-pooling supports any layout as long as &apos;H&apos; and &apos;W&apos; appear.
 *        The layout is supposed to be composed of upper cases, lower cases and (optional) numbers,
 *        where upper case indicates a dimension and
 *        the corresponding lower case (with factor size) indicates the sub-dimension.
 *        For example, `NCHW16c` can describe a 5-D tensor of
 *        [batch_size, channel, height, width, channel_block].
 *        (in which factor size `16` will not be used in pooling but for other operators,
 *        it can be used to decide the output shape).
 *        Since pooling does not care about the factor size of
 *        dimensions other than `H` and `W`, one can pass `NCHWc` as well.
 *
 * \return The output tensor in same layout with height and width dimension size of 1.
 *         e.g., for NCHW, the output shape will be [batch, channel, 1, 1]
