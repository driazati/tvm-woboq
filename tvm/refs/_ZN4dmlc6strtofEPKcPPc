 * \brief A faster implementation of strtof(). See documentation of
 *        std::strtof() for more information. Note that this function does not
 *        check for overflow. Use strtof_check_range() to check for overflow.
 * TODO: the current version does not support hex number
 * TODO: the current version does not handle long decimals: you may only have
 *       up to 19 digits after the decimal point, and you cannot have too many
 *       digits before the decimal point either.
 * \param nptr Beginning of the string that&apos;s to be converted into float
 * \param endptr After the conversion, this pointer will be set to point one
 *               past the last character used in the conversion.
 * \return Converted floating-point value, in float type
