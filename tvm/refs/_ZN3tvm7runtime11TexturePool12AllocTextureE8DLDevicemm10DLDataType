   * \brief Allocate a two dimensional temporal texture workspace on device
   *
   * \note Two dimensional texture workspaces will be grown and reused
   * according to the following strategy:
   *  - Choose the workspace which minimizes the amount of memory required to
   *    grow the workspace to fit the request.
   *  - If a set of workspaces exist that fit the current request without
   *    expansion, choose the workspace of that set which most closely
   *    matches the request size, minimizing wasted space.
   *
   * \param dev The context of allocation.
   * \param width The width of the 2d texture to be allocated.
   * \param height The height of the 2d texture to be allocated.
   * \param type_hint The type of elements.
